# E-Commerce-SOZE-Wear
E-Commerce project developed in **Angular 2** and **SpringBoot framework**.

This is a project for my **Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science**.

## Short description

Project represents e-commerce web shop for SOZE Wear brand. It consists usual use cases of a modern e-commerce information system.
Use cases:

+ login/registration of users
+ representation of the products
+ wishlist functionality
+ shopping cart functionality
+ products ordering process
+ categories and products CRUD for administrators

Login and registration is implemented with **Auth0 service**, using **JWT** and **social networks accounts**.
Project has **integrated elasticsearch component** for context searching of the products. Showcase of the component consists of three different searches. **Phrases search, fuzzy search and simple query search**.

**Please be aware that this is still a student project, I am quite aware of many flaws that this project consists. Functionality and code wise. The idea for the project was to set the basic UI and most of the functionality, and spend more time on research of the Auth0, JWT and Elasticsearch.**

**Good luck!**
